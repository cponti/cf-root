cf-root Specification
=====================

/cf-root is a file server repository and it contains all configuration files 
that must be copied to the nodes.

You can place brocken symbolic links in the /cf-root directory; updatenodes.sh
transfers the the symbolic link.

A file in the file server repository can either be sent to all nodes or to a 
specific host name. To associate a file with a specific host name add a 
._hostname extension to the file - the file will only be transferred to the 
node corresponding to that host name. During file transfer the ._hostname 
extension is removed. The ._hostname extension must come at the end of the 
file name.

Permission and ownership in /cf-root will be inherit on the node.

If you add or modify a file in /cf-root then you must run the following command 
immediately after:

  # updatenodes.sh -u -v

Only new or modified files will be copied to the node.

This command line is also invoke every night via crontab file.

  # crontab -l

  #                       of              of
